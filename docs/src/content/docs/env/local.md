The `local` directory is copied over to `~/.local`.

An extra line in my shell config adds `~/.local/scripts` to my path, which means executable scripts inside this directory are available globally for my user.

I wasn't going to use this but I wrote a little `git-done` script and put it in `local/scripts` and now it's ready for use whenever I'm done using a branch in git.

You can [view the scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/paultibbetts/dev/tree/main/local).
