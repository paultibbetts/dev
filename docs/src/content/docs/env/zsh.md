I use [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell.

I made the config file (`~/.zshrc`) a little easier to work with by making it load in all the files in the `~/.zsh` directory.

This means I can get to my aliases by going to `zsh/aliases.sh`, instead of looking through a long `.zshrc` file to find the part with the aliases in.

You can [view the files on GitHub](https://github.com/paultibbetts/dev/tree/main/zsh).
