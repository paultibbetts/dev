Gets the system ready to install tools.

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for macOS so it's installed first. 

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is installed by Homebrew.

The install script uses Git to download the rest of the code onto the machine it's installing to.
