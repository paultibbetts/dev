Finally, the good stuff.

## Terminal

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) is my preferred terminal.

## Tmux

I interact with the terminal using [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) which is a terminal multiplexer, meaning it does windows and "tabs" and stuff.

## Starship

My prompt uses [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

Right now it looks like this:

```
dev on feat/astro [$âœ˜!?] is ðŸ“¦ v1.0.0 via â¬¢ v22.16.0
```

which shows me

- `dev` is the directory I'm in
- `feat/astro` is the git branch I'm on
- `[$x!?]` means that there are new files and changes to old ones
- `is v1.0.0` shows my current version of this project
- `via (node) v22.16.0` tells me I'm using Node.js version 22.16.0

## Nerd font

Starship requires me to install a [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

## Editor

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my editor.

## CLI

I spend most of my time on the command line using these:

### atuin

records the commands I run so I can search through my history to find out what I did.

[website](https://atuin.sh/)

### bat

"`cat` with wings".

[website](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

### bottom

a better `top`.

### delta

### eza

### fd

### fzf

### lazygit

is a [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) for interacting with git.

I haven't had it installed for long but I can already see it speeding up common git operations.

### sd

a better `sed`.

### tealdeer

It's like `man` but shortened to results you'll actually use.

## Web Development

The rest of the tools are catered to web development.

### ansible

### docker

### nerdctl

It's installed with `colima` and is available by running `colima nerdctl`.
